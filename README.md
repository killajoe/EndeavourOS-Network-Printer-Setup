You can use this on your own risk:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/killajoe/fileserver/main/Convenience-printer-installation  &&  chmod +x Convenience-printer-installation && ./Convenience-printer-installation```

Possible to use this on the installer from welcome too:

pressing the button right bottom "Fetch your install customization file (advanced)"  and paste the raw script url into the popup field.. 

```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/killajoe/fileserver/main/Convenience-printer-installation```

For this to work you will need to choose printing support (Cups) in Packages screen (only available for online install methods):
